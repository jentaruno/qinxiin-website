                    <p>SILENT BLUES (X ¥) is a social media—based illustrated mental health campaign which will tackle
                        various topics close to us, such as daily life, mental illness awareness, human life, and others
                        through enchanting visuals: comics, animations, storylines, and even interactive challenges! The
                        project
                        has three main sections: Memoir, Echo, and Labyrinth.

                    <p>Just like before, I'm aiming to help people by letting them know that they're not struggling
                        along through this project, giving them a sense of belonging.</p>
